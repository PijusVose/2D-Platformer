# 2D Platformer with Unity
A simple 2D Platformer made with Unity and some assets from the Unity Asset Store.

I've been learning and trying to implement the new Input System, so I created this small project to try it out. I have keyboard/mouse and gamepad input already, planning to add more platforms later.
